# ba1-mp1-parser

This is a python parser that is used to process data outputed by [our BA1 project](https://github.com/arthur-wolf/ba1-mp1).

In order to do this, we added a method to output what was written in the terminal to a text file, which we then used as an input for this parser.
It processes the data and prints it out in the terminal.

It has been very useful to verifiy our results and to adjust our code in order to fulfill the requirements.
